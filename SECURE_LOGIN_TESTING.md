## üß™ **Complete Testing Protocol**

### **Step 1: Start Your Secure System**

```powershell
cd client
python app.py
```

### **Step 2: Test New User Registration**

#### **Test 2A: Valid Registration**

```powershell
# 1. Go to: http://localhost:5000

```

#### **Test 2C: Duplicate ID Prevention**

```powershell
# Try to register with same User ID:
# - User ID: prof-secure-test (same as above)
# - Different name: Dr. Different Name
# Expected: Error "User ID prof-secure-test is already registered"
```

#### **Test 2D: Duplicate Name Prevention**

```powershell
# Try to register with same name:
# - User ID: prof-different-id
# - Name: Dr. Secure Test (same as above)
# Expected: Error "A user with the name 'Dr. Secure Test' already exists"
```

### **Step 3: Test Returning User Login**

#### **Test 3A: Correct Password**

```powershell
# 1. Logout from previous session
# 2. Start typing: prof-secure-test
# 3. Expected: Auto-fills name, role, block (but NOT password)
# 4. Enter correct password: mypassword123
# 5. Expected: "Welcome back, Dr. Secure Test!"
```

#### **Test 3B: Wrong Password**

```powershell
# 1. Type: prof-secure-test (auto-fills data)
# 2. Enter wrong password: wrongpassword
# 3. Expected: Error "Invalid password. Please check your password and try again."
```

#### **Test 3C: Role Mismatch**

```powershell
# 1. Type: prof-secure-test (auto-fills as professor)
# 2. Manually select "Student" role
# 3. Enter correct password
# 4. Expected: Error "User prof-secure-test is registered as professor, not student"
```

### **Step 4: Test Password Security Features**

#### **Test 4A: Password Toggle**

```powershell
# 1. Type password in password field
# 2. Click eye icon (üëÅÔ∏è) next to password
# 3. Expected: Password becomes visible, icon changes to üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è
# 4. Click again
# 5. Expected: Password hidden again
```

#### **Test 4B: No Auto-Complete**

```powershell
# 1. Type existing User ID (auto-fills name, role, block)
# 2. Check password field
# 3. Expected: Password field remains empty (security)
# 4. Expected: Focus automatically moves to password field
```

## üë• **Multi-User Security Testing**

### **For Your Classmates:**

**Send this secure testing protocol:**

**üîê SECURE BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEM TESTING**

**Access:** `http://[YOUR_IP]:5000`

**Security Testing Protocol:**

**Phase 1: Registration Security**

```
Each person try to register with these credentials:
- User ID: test-student-1 (same for everyone)
- Name: [Your actual name]
- Password: [Your choice, min 6 chars]

Expected: Only FIRST person succeeds, others get "User ID already taken"
```

**Phase 2: Password Validation**

```
Try these invalid passwords:
- "123" (too short)
- "12345" (too short)
- "123456" (minimum valid)

Expected: Proper validation messages
```

**Phase 3: Unique Credentials**

```
Use these UNIQUE credentials (pick one):

Student 1: student-alice | Alice Johnson | password123 | Block 33
Student 2: student-bob | Bob Wilson | securepass | Block 34
Student 3: student-carol | Carol Davis | mypassword | Block 35
Professor 1: prof-smith | Dr. Smith | profpass123 | Block 33
Professor 2: prof-garcia | Dr. Garcia | teacherpass | Block 34
```

**Phase 4: Login Security Test**

```
1. Everyone login with their credentials
2. Logout and try to login with someone else's User ID
3. Try wrong passwords
4. Try wrong roles

Expected: Proper authentication and error messages
```

### **Coordinated Security Demo:**

#### **Demo 1: Duplicate Prevention**

```powershell
# YOU: Register as prof-demo
# CLASSMATE 1: Try same User ID prof-demo
# Expected: Duplicate ID error

# CLASSMATE 2: Try same name but different ID
# Expected: Duplicate name error
```

#### **Demo 2: Password Security**

```powershell
# YOU: Login with correct password
# CLASSMATE: Try to login as you with wrong password
# Expected: Authentication failure

# Show: Password field never auto-completes
# Show: Password toggle works for visibility
```

#### **Demo 3: Role Security**

```powershell
# YOU: Register as professor
# CLASSMATE: Try to login as you but select "student" role
# Expected: Role mismatch error
```
